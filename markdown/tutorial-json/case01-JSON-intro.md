# JSON - Introduction

## What is JSON?

° JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

° JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data

° JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

## Why Use JSON?

The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. 

Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.

Furthermode, you can:

1. You can receive pure text from a server and use it as a JavaScript object.

2. You can send a JavaScript object to a server in pure text format.

3. You can work with data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.

## Storing Data

When storing data, the data has to be a certain format, and regardless of where you choose to store it, text is always one of the legal formats.

JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript objects as text.
